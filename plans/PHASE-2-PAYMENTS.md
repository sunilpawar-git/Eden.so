## 1. Executive Summary

ActionStation is a BASB (Building a Second Brain) infinite canvas application running on Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Storage) with a React/Vite frontend. Phase 1 resolved all launch blockers — domain config, CORS/CSP SSOT, health endpoint hardening, immutable backups, uptime monitoring, and deploy workflow validation.

Phase 2 integrates **Stripe** as the sole payment gateway for an India + Global hybrid market (INR + international currencies). The architecture achieves **PCI DSS SAQ A** compliance by ensuring card data **never touches ActionStation servers** — all payment data is handled entirely by Stripe Checkout and Stripe's PCI Level 1 certified infrastructure.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Stripe only** (no Razorpay) | Stripe India supports INR, UPI, netbanking, and international cards. Single integration reduces attack surface. |
| **Stripe Checkout** (hosted) | Card data never enters our environment. PCI SAQ A eligible. |
| **PCI DSS SAQ A** | <20K transactions/year, no card data handling. Self-assessment questionnaire only. |
| **SOC 2 / ISO 27001 deferred** | Out of scope for this phase. Foundation controls built now will accelerate future certification. |
| **Phase 3 (limits) / Phase 4 (legal) remain separate** | This plan is payments + security only. Tightly scoped for 12-week delivery. |

## 2. Scope, Objectives, and Success Criteria

### 2.1 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Stripe account setup, product/price configuration (Free + Pro tiers, INR + USD)
- Cloud Functions: `createCheckoutSession`, `stripeWebhook`, `createBillingPortalSession`
- Webhook event processing: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `invoice.paid`
- Firestore subscription document writes from webhooks
- Subscription state loading on auth (wire `loadSubscription` into auth flow)
- Billing UI: PricingCard, UpgradePrompt, subscription status in AccountSection
- Stripe Customer Portal integration for self-service management
- Secrets management: Stripe keys in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Key lifecycle: generation, rotation, backup, revocation procedures
- Security hardening: webhook signature verification, idempotency, rate limiting
- Cloud Armor WAF deployment (scripted in Phase 1, executed in Phase 2)
- Turnstile CAPTCHA client-side integration on LoginPage
- PCI DSS SAQ A compliance documentation and evidence
- Threat model (STRIDE) and risk register
- Incident response runbooks for payment events
- Penetration testing plan and execution
- Monitoring dashboards for payment health and security posture

**Out of Scope:**
- Free tier limit enforcement (Phase 3)
- Legal pages — Terms of Service, Privacy Policy (Phase 4)
- Landing page and marketing site (Phase 5)
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 certification
- Multi-currency dynamic pricing (single price per currency at launch)
- Subscription plan changes (upgrade/downgrade mid-cycle) — defer to Phase 3
- Refund automation — manual via Stripe Dashboard initially
- On-premises infrastructure (fully cloud-native on GCP/Firebase)

### 2.2 Objectives

### 6.3 Data Classification

| Data Element | Classification | Storage | Encryption | Retention |
|-------------|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Card number (PAN) | **PCI — Never stored** | Stripe only | N/A | N/A |
| CVV/CVC | **PCI — Never stored** | Stripe only | N/A | N/A |
| Stripe Customer ID | Internal | Firestore | AES-256 at rest (GCP default) | Account lifetime |
| Stripe Subscription ID | Internal | Firestore | AES-256 at rest | Account lifetime |
| Webhook event IDs | Internal | Firestore | AES-256 at rest | 30 days (TTL) |
| Stripe Secret Key | Secret | Secret Manager | AES-256 (envelope) | Until rotated |
| Stripe Webhook Signing Secret | Secret | Secret Manager | AES-256 (envelope) | Until rotated |
| Subscription tier/status | Internal | Firestore | AES-256 at rest | Account lifetime |
| Billing email | PII | Stripe only (not stored locally) | Stripe manages | Per Stripe DPA |

### 6.4 Data Residency

- **Firestore**: `us-central1` (existing project region) — multi-region replication within US
- **Cloud Functions**: `us-central1` (co-located with Firestore for latency)
- **Secret Manager**: `us-central1` with automatic replication to `us-east1` (GCP default for Secret Manager)
- **Stripe**: Data processed in Stripe's PCI Level 1 infrastructure (US + India for INR transactions)
- **Indian data residency (RBI)**: Stripe India stores card data within India for INR transactions per RBI mandate. ActionStation never handles card data, so RBI card storage rules do not apply to our infrastructure.

**P2PE Considerations:** Point-to-Point Encryption is not applicable — ActionStation is a web SaaS with no physical card terminals. All card input occurs on Stripe Checkout's hosted page, which uses Stripe.js with TLS encryption directly to Stripe's servers.

## 8. Security Architecture and Controls

### 8.1 Identity and Access Management

| Control | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **MFA** | Google OAuth (inherits user's Google MFA setting) + Turnstile CAPTCHA challenge | Phase 2 — Turnstile client integration |
| **Least Privilege** | Cloud Functions SA has only `secretmanager.secretAccessor`, `datastore.user`, `storage.objectAdmin` | Existing |
| **RBAC** | Two tiers: `free` and `pro`. Subscription document is write-only from server. Client reads via Firestore rules. | Existing read path; Phase 2 adds write path |
| **Session Management** | Firebase Auth ID tokens (1-hour expiry, auto-refresh). No long-lived session cookies. | Existing |
| **Service Account Isolation** | Each Cloud Function uses the default Firebase SA. No cross-project access. | Existing |

### 8.2 Secrets Management

**Backend: Google Cloud Secret Manager**

| Secret | Purpose | Rotation Schedule | Backup |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Server-side Stripe API calls | 90 days | Secret Manager versioning (automatic) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature verification | 90 days | Secret Manager versioning |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini AI proxy | 90 days | Secret Manager versioning |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | Cloudflare Turnstile verification | 180 days | Secret Manager versioning |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` | reCAPTCHA v3 verification | 180 days | Secret Manager versioning |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Calendar OAuth | 365 days (Google-managed) | Secret Manager versioning |

**Why Google Cloud Secret Manager (not HashiCorp Vault):**
- Native integration with Cloud Functions via `defineSecret()`
- Zero additional infrastructure — no Vault server to manage
- Automatic envelope encryption (AES-256 + KMS master key)
- IAM-based access control (same as existing GCP IAM)
- Audit logging via Cloud Audit Logs (every secret access logged)
- Automatic multi-region replication within GCP
- Version history enables instant rollback on bad rotation

**HashiCorp Vault would be appropriate if:** on-premises infrastructure existed, multi-cloud key management was needed, or dynamic secrets (short-lived database credentials) were required. None apply here.

### 8.3 Key Lifecycle Management

#### Generation
- All secrets generated by their respective providers (Stripe Dashboard, Cloudflare Dashboard, Google Cloud Console)
- Stripe keys generated with restricted permissions (read-only where possible)
- No secrets generated manually or stored in plaintext anywhere

#### Storage
- **All secrets stored exclusively in Google Cloud Secret Manager**
- Envelope encryption: secret encrypted with DEK → DEK encrypted with KEK in Cloud KMS
- Access requires both IAM permission AND the KEK in KMS
- No secrets in `.env` files, GitHub Secrets (except `VITE_` prefixed publishable keys), or code

#### Rotation Procedure
```
1. Generate new secret version in provider (Stripe Dashboard / Cloudflare)
2. Add new version to Secret Manager:
   gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_NAME --data-file=- <<< "new_secret_value"
3. Verify new version is accessible:
   gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=SECRET_NAME
4. Cloud Functions automatically pick up new version on next cold start
5. Force cold start if immediate rotation needed:
   gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --no-traffic (then restore)
6. Verify webhook/API calls succeed with new secret (monitor Cloud Logging)
7. Disable old secret version after 24-hour soak:
   gcloud secrets versions disable OLD_VERSION --secret=SECRET_NAME
8. Destroy old version after 30-day retention:
   gcloud secrets versions destroy OLD_VERSION --secret=SECRET_NAME
```

#### Rotation Schedule

| Secret | Rotation Interval | Next Rotation | Responsible |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | 90 days | Launch + 90d | DevOps |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | 90 days | Launch + 90d | DevOps |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | 90 days | Existing schedule | DevOps |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | 180 days | Launch + 180d | DevOps |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` | 180 days | Launch + 180d | DevOps |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | 365 days | Google-managed | DevOps |

#### Backup
- Secret Manager automatically retains all versions until explicitly destroyed
- Cross-region: Secret Manager replicates to multiple GCP regions by default
- Recovery: `gcloud secrets versions access VERSION_NUMBER --secret=SECRET_NAME`
- **No manual backup files** — Secret Manager IS the backup system
- Emergency access: Break-glass procedure via Organization Admin role (documented in runbook)

#### Revocation
```
1. IMMEDIATE: Disable the compromised secret version:
   gcloud secrets versions disable VERSION --secret=SECRET_NAME
2. Generate new secret in provider dashboard
3. Add to Secret Manager as new version
4. Force cold start of affected Cloud Functions
5. Log security incident via logSecurityEvent('KEY_REVOCATION', {...})
6. Notify stakeholders per incident response procedure
7. Destroy compromised version after confirmation:
   gcloud secrets versions destroy VERSION --secret=SECRET_NAME
```

#### Escrow
- Not applicable for SaaS API keys — no physical key escrow needed
- Secret Manager's version history serves as the recovery mechanism
- Organization-level IAM break-glass access provides emergency recovery path

### 8.4 Encryption

| Layer | Standard | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **In Transit** | TLS 1.2+ (1.3 preferred) | Firebase Hosting (Google-managed cert), Cloud Functions (GCP edge), Stripe API (Stripe-managed) |
| **At Rest (Firestore)** | AES-256 | GCP default encryption (Google-managed keys, envelope encryption via Cloud KMS) |
| **At Rest (Secret Manager)** | AES-256 + KMS envelope | Automatic — each secret version encrypted with unique DEK, DEK encrypted with KEK in Cloud KMS |
| **At Rest (GCS Backups)** | AES-256 | GCP default + immutable retention policy (Decision 29) |
| **Client-Server** | TLS 1.3 | HSTS enforced (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`) |
| **Function-to-Stripe** | TLS 1.2+ | Stripe SDK enforces minimum TLS 1.2 |
| **Webhook Payload Integrity** | HMAC-SHA256 | `stripe-signature` header verified with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |

### 8.5 Access Logging and Audit Trails

| Event | Log Destination | Retention | Alert |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Secret access | Cloud Audit Logs (Data Access) | 400 days | Anomalous access pattern |
| Subscription state change | Cloud Logging (structured) | 30 days (default), 400 days (audit sink) | Payment failure spike |
| Webhook signature failure | Cloud Logging + securityLogger | 30 days | Immediate (CRITICAL) |
| Stripe API errors | Cloud Logging | 30 days | 5xx spike |
| Auth failures | Cloud Logging + securityLogger | 30 days | Auth failure spike (existing) |
| Rate limit violations | Cloud Logging + securityLogger | 30 days | 429 spike (existing) |
| WAF blocks | Cloud Armor logs | 400 days | Block rate spike |
| Key rotation events | Cloud Audit Logs | 400 days | N/A (scheduled) |

### 8.6 Tamper Resistance

- **Firestore rules**: `subscription` subcollection is `allow write: if false` for clients (existing `firestore.rules:20-23`). Only Cloud Functions (admin SDK, bypasses rules) can write subscription state.
- **Webhook idempotency**: `_webhookEvents` collection prevents replay attacks. Client has no write access (`allow write: if false`).
- **Immutable backups**: GCS object retention policy prevents deletion of Firestore backups for 30 days (Decision 29).
- **Gitleaks**: CI pipeline blocks commits containing secrets (existing in deploy.yml).
- **Structural tests**: Build-time verification that secrets never appear in client code (new D29, D30).

### 9.2 Firewall Rules

| Rule | Direction | Source | Destination | Port | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| Cloud Armor default-deny | Inbound | * | LB | 443 | Evaluate WAF rules |
| OWASP CRS SQLi | Inbound | * | LB | 443 | Block on match |
| OWASP CRS XSS | Inbound | * | LB | 443 | Block on match |
| IP rate limit | Inbound | * | LB | 443 | Throttle at 100/min |
| Allow Stripe webhooks | Inbound | Stripe IPs | CF | 443 | Allow (verified by signature) |
| Cloud Functions → Stripe | Outbound | CF | Stripe API | 443 | Allow |
| Cloud Functions → Firestore | Outbound | CF | Firestore | 443 | Allow (GCP internal) |
| Cloud Functions → Secret Manager | Outbound | CF | Secret Manager | 443 | Allow (GCP internal) |

**Note:** Cloud Functions on GCP do not have traditional firewall rules — they are serverless and communicate over GCP's internal network. The "firewall" is implemented via Cloud Armor (edge) + application-layer security checks (bot detection, rate limiting, auth).

### 9.3 Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**Implementation:** Cloud Armor with OWASP CRS v3.3 (from `scripts/setup-cloud-armor.sh`)

| Rule Set | Priority | Action | Coverage |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| SQL Injection (sqli-v33-stable) | 1000 | Block | SQL injection attempts |
| XSS (xss-v33-stable) | 1001 | Block | Cross-site scripting |
| Local File Inclusion (lfi-v33-stable) | 1002 | Block | Path traversal |
| Remote File Inclusion (rfi-v33-stable) | 1003 | Block | URL injection |
| Remote Code Execution (rce-v33-stable) | 1004 | Block | Command injection |
| Method Enforcement (methodenforcement-v33-stable) | 1005 | Block | Invalid HTTP methods |
| Scanner Detection (scannerdetection-v33-stable) | 1006 | Block | Automated scanners |
| Protocol Attack (protocolattack-v33-stable) | 1007 | Block | HTTP protocol abuse |
| IP Rate Limit | 900 | Throttle (5-min ban) | DDoS / brute force |

**False Positive Monitoring:** 2-week observation period after deployment. Tune rules by adding exceptions for legitimate webhook payloads from Stripe.

### 9.4 IDS/IPS

**Implementation:** Application-layer detection (existing security stack)

| Component | Function | File |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Bot Detector | Scanner/automation UA detection | `functions/src/utils/botDetector.ts` |
| Prompt Filter | AI injection/exfiltration detection | `functions/src/utils/promptFilter.ts` |
| Threat Monitor | Spike detection (429, 500, auth fail, bot) | `functions/src/utils/threatMonitor.ts` |
| File Upload Validator | Malicious file detection | `functions/src/utils/fileUploadValidator.ts` |

**New for Phase 2:**
- Add `WEBHOOK_SIG_FAILURE` event type to `securityLogger.ts`
- Add `PAYMENT_FAILED` event type to `securityLogger.ts`
- Add `SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE` event type to `securityLogger.ts`
- Threshold for webhook signature failures: >5/min → CRITICAL alert

### 9.5 Secure Logging and SIEM Integration

**Logging Architecture:**
```
Cloud Functions → stdout/stderr (structured JSON)
    → Cloud Logging (automatic ingestion)
        → Log-based metrics (429 spike, 500 spike, auth fail, bot detect)
            → Cloud Monitoring alerting
                → Email + Slack notification channels
```

**SIEM Integration:**
- Cloud Logging serves as the SIEM for this scale
- Log Router can export to BigQuery for long-term analysis if needed
- Structured JSON format with `labels.eden_security: "true"` enables precise filtering
- All payment events carry `correlationId` (Stripe event ID) for cross-system tracing

**New Log Events for Phase 2:**

| Event Type | Severity | Trigger | Data Logged |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE` | INFO | Any subscription write | userId, oldTier, newTier, eventId |
| `PAYMENT_FAILED` | WARNING | invoice.payment_failed webhook | userId, invoiceId, failureReason |
| `WEBHOOK_SIG_FAILURE` | ERROR | Invalid stripe-signature | IP, requestHeaders (redacted), timestamp |
| `CHECKOUT_CREATED` | INFO | createCheckoutSession success | userId, priceId, currency |
| `KEY_ROTATION` | INFO | Secret version change | secretName, newVersion, operator |

### 9.6 Anomaly Detection

| Anomaly | Detection Method | Threshold | Response |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Payment failure spike | Cloud Monitoring metric | >10 failures/hour | Alert → manual review |
| Webhook sig failure spike | threatMonitor.ts | >5/min | CRITICAL log → immediate investigation |
| Checkout session abuse | IP rate limiter | >10 checkouts/min per IP | 429 + 5-min ban |
| Subscription state tampering attempt | Firestore rules | Any client write to subscription/ | Silently denied (rules) |
| Secret access anomaly | Cloud Audit Logs | Access outside deploy/cold-start | Alert → investigation |

### 9.7 Incident Response

See [Section 12.7](#127-payment-incident-response) for payment-specific runbooks.

**General Security Incident Response:**

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Detection** | Automated alert fires (Cloud Monitoring / threatMonitor) | 0 min |
| **Triage** | On-call reviews alert, determines severity (P1-P4) | <15 min |
| **Containment** | Disable compromised secret, block source IP, disable function | <30 min |
| **Eradication** | Rotate secrets, patch vulnerability, update WAF rules | <4 hours |
| **Recovery** | Verify systems operational, re-enable services | <8 hours |
| **Lessons Learned** | Post-incident review, update runbooks, file MEMORY.md decision | <48 hours |

### 9.8 Vulnerability Management

| Activity | Cadence | Tool |
|----------|---------|------|
| Dependency vulnerability scan | Every CI run | `npm audit` (existing in deploy.yml) |
| SCA (Software Composition Analysis) | Weekly | `npm audit` + Dependabot (GitHub) |
| DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) | Monthly | OWASP ZAP automated scan |
| Container/runtime patching | Continuous | Cloud Functions runtime managed by GCP |
| Secret scanning | Every commit | Gitleaks (existing in CI) |
| WAF rule updates | Quarterly | Cloud Armor OWASP CRS version bump |

### 9.9 Patching Cadence

| Component | Patching Approach | Cadence |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Cloud Functions runtime (Node 22) | GCP-managed, automatic | Continuous |
| `stripe` npm package | Dependabot PR | Within 7 days of release |
| `firebase-admin` / `firebase-functions` | Dependabot PR | Within 14 days |
| Frontend dependencies | Dependabot PR | Within 14 days |
| Cloud Armor WAF rules | Manual version bump | Quarterly |

### 9.10 Secure SDLC

| Phase | Controls |
|-------|----------|
| **Design** | STRIDE threat model, security requirements in WBS |
| **Code** | Structural tests (no secrets in code, webhook sig verification), ESLint security rules |
| **Build** | `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + test), Gitleaks secret scan, `npm audit` |
| **Test** | Unit tests, integration tests, OWASP ZAP DAST, manual pen test |
| **Deploy** | Secret validation step, canary rollout, automated rollback |
| **Operate** | Cloud Monitoring alerts, Cloud Audit Logs, key rotation schedule |

### 9.11 Supply Chain Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Lock file integrity** | `npm ci` (not `npm install`) in CI — respects `package-lock.json` exactly |
| **Dependency audit** | `npm audit` blocks deploy on critical vulnerabilities (existing) |
| **Minimal dependencies** | `stripe` is the only new production dependency for Phase 2 |
| **Dependabot** | Enabled for automated dependency update PRs |
| **No post-install scripts** | Verify `stripe` package has no install scripts (`npm pack --dry-run`) |
| **Signed commits** | Recommended for production deployments |

### 9.12 Vendor Risk Management

| Vendor | Service | Risk Level | Controls |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Stripe** | Payment processing | High | PCI Level 1 certified, SOC 2 Type II, annual review of Stripe's compliance page |
| **Google Cloud (Firebase)** | Hosting, Firestore, Functions, Secret Manager | High | SOC 2/3, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, annual review |
| **Cloudflare** | Turnstile CAPTCHA | Medium | SOC 2, review annually |
| **Sentry** | Error monitoring | Low | SOC 2, data masking enabled (`maskAllText`, `blockAllMedia`) |
| **PostHog** | Analytics | Low | SOC 2, `autocapture: false`, `respect_dnt: true` |

---

## 10. Compliance Mapping

### 10.1 PCI DSS Scope Definition

**Merchant Level:** Level 4 (<20,000 e-commerce transactions/year)

**SAQ Type:** SAQ A — Card-not-present merchants that have fully outsourced all cardholder data functions to PCI DSS compliant third-party service providers.

**Justification for SAQ A:**
1. ✅ All payment processing is entirely outsourced to Stripe (PCI Level 1)
2. ✅ No electronic storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data on our systems
3. ✅ Card data is entered exclusively on Stripe Checkout's hosted pages
4. ✅ No `stripe.js` elements that could capture card data — using Stripe Checkout redirect mode
5. ✅ No payment page served from our domain — full redirect to `checkout.stripe.com`

**CDE (Cardholder Data Environment):** Does not exist within ActionStation's infrastructure. The CDE is entirely within Stripe's environment.

### 10.2 PCI DSS Requirements Mapping (SAQ A)

| PCI Requirement | SAQ A Relevance | ActionStation Implementation |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Req 2: No vendor-supplied defaults** | N/A (no CDE) | All secrets unique, generated by providers |
| **Req 6: Secure systems and software** | Applicable | Secure SDLC, structural tests, dependency scanning, Gitleaks |
| **Req 8: Identify and authenticate access** | Applicable | Firebase Auth (Google OAuth), MFA via Google, least privilege IAM |
| **Req 9: Physical access** | N/A (cloud-only) | Managed by GCP (SOC 2 certified) |
| **Req 11: Test security** | Applicable | Pen test, OWASP ZAP DAST, structural tests |
| **Req 12: Security policy** | Applicable | AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, this document |

### 10.3 PCI Data Handling Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Tokenization** | Stripe handles all tokenization. ActionStation stores only `cus_xxx`, `sub_xxx`, `price_xxx` identifiers — never card tokens. |
| **Encryption** | TLS 1.2+ for all external communication. AES-256 at rest for all GCP storage. |
| **Logging** | No PAN, CVV, or card data in any log. Logs contain only Stripe object IDs. |
| **Data minimization** | Only subscription metadata stored in Firestore — no billing address, no card details. |
| **Retention** | Subscription data retained for account lifetime. Webhook events TTL 30 days. |

### 10.4 PCI Reporting Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Responsible |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| SAQ A self-assessment | D17 — Week 10 | Security |
| Attestation of Compliance (AOC) | Part of SAQ A | Security |
| Stripe PCI Level 1 AOC | Request from Stripe | Ops |
| Quarterly network scan (ASV) | Not required for SAQ A | N/A |
| Annual penetration test | D22 — Week 9 | Security |

### 10.5 Data Privacy (GDPR / CCPA)

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Lawful basis (GDPR Art. 6)** | Contract performance (subscription) + legitimate interest (fraud prevention) |
| **Data minimization** | Only Stripe customer/subscription IDs stored. No card data, no billing address. |
| **Right to access** | Subscription data accessible via Account settings. Full export in Phase 4. |
| **Right to erasure** | Account deletion removes all Firestore data including subscription record. Stripe data subject to Stripe's DPA. |
| **Right to portability** | JSON export of subscription metadata. Full data export in Phase 4. |
| **Data processor agreement** | Stripe DPA covers payment data processing. Firebase/GCP DPA covers infrastructure. |
| **CCPA (California)** | "Do Not Sell" not applicable — no personal data sold. Privacy Policy (Phase 4) will include CCPA disclosures. |
| **Cookie consent** | Stripe Checkout runs on Stripe's domain — their cookie policy applies there. Our domain: consent banner in Phase 4. |

### 10.6 Data Retention and Deletion

| Data | Retention | Deletion Trigger |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `subscription/current` document | Account lifetime | Account deletion |
| `_webhookEvents` records | 30 days (TTL) | Automatic Firestore TTL |
| Stripe customer record | Per Stripe DPA | Account deletion request → manual Stripe deletion or API call |
| Cloud Logging (payment events) | 30 days (default) | Automatic |
| Cloud Audit Logs | 400 days | GCP policy |
| Firestore backups (GCS) | 30-day immutable + 90-day lifecycle | Automatic |

---

## 11. Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment

### 11.1 STRIDE Threat Model

**System:** Stripe payment integration for ActionStation

| Threat Category | Threat | Component | Mitigation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker sends fake webhook pretending to be Stripe | stripeWebhook | HMAC-SHA256 signature verification via `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| **Spoofing** | Attacker creates checkout session for another user | createCheckoutSession | Firebase Auth verification (ID token → UID) |
| **Spoofing** | Stolen Firebase ID token used to create checkout | createCheckoutSession | Token expiry (1hr), IP rate limiting, bot detection |
| **Tampering** | Webhook payload modified in transit | stripeWebhook | Stripe signature verification (covers entire payload) |
| **Tampering** | Client modifies subscription document directly | Firestore | Security rules: `allow write: if false` on subscription subcollection |
| **Tampering** | Attacker modifies `_webhookEvents` to allow replay | Firestore | Security rules: no client access to `_webhookEvents` |
| **Repudiation** | User claims they never subscribed | - | Stripe receipts + Cloud Logging audit trail + Stripe event ID correlation |
| **Repudiation** | Admin claims they never rotated a key | - | Cloud Audit Logs (immutable, 400-day retention) |
| **Information Disclosure** | Stripe secret key leaked in logs | Cloud Logging | Secrets never logged. `filterPromptOutput` scans for key patterns. Structural test D29. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Stripe secret key leaked in client bundle | Frontend build | `defineSecret()` keeps key server-side. Structural test verifies no `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in client. |
| **Information Disclosure** | PAN/CVV logged in error reports | Sentry/PostHog | PAN never enters our system (Stripe Checkout hosted). Sentry `maskAllText: true`. |
| **Denial of Service** | Flood of fake webhook calls | stripeWebhook | Cloud Armor rate limit + bot detection. Signature verification rejects invalid payloads quickly. |
| **Denial of Service** | Flood of checkout session creation | createCheckoutSession | IP rate limit (30/min) + user rate limit (60/min) + Cloud Armor (100/min) |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Free user manipulates client to access Pro features | Client | Server-side enforcement: AI endpoint checks subscription in Firestore (Phase 3). Client-side gate is UX only. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Expired subscription still shows Pro | Client | `subscriptionService` checks `expiresAt` on every read. Server-side webhook updates on `customer.subscription.deleted`. |

### 11.2 Risk Register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---|------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| R1 | Stripe webhook secret compromised | Low | Critical | High | Secret Manager + 90-day rotation + revocation runbook | Low |
| R2 | Webhook delivery failure (Stripe outage) | Medium | High | High | Stripe retries for 72h. Manual reconciliation runbook. | Medium |
| R3 | Race condition in idempotency check | Low | Medium | Medium | Firestore transaction for idempotency write. Worst case: duplicate subscription write (idempotent). | Low |
| R4 | Cloud Functions cold start delays webhook processing | Medium | Low | Low | Stripe tolerates up to 20s response time. Min instances=1 for webhook function. | Low |
| R5 | WAF false positive blocks Stripe webhook | Low | High | Medium | Stripe webhooks verified by signature, not WAF. Monitor WAF logs for Stripe IP blocks. | Low |
| R6 | Developer accidentally logs Stripe secret | Low | Critical | High | Structural test prevents secret references in code. `filterPromptOutput` scans for key patterns. Code review. | Low |
| R7 | Stripe publishable key in client used for unauthorized purposes | Low | Low | Low | Publishable keys are designed to be public. They cannot access sensitive operations. | Accepted |
| R8 | Subscription state drift (Firestore vs Stripe) | Low | Medium | Medium | Periodic reconciliation script. `lastEventId` tracks latest processed event. | Low |
| R9 | DDoS on checkout endpoint | Medium | Medium | Medium | Cloud Armor + IP rate limit + user rate limit. Stripe has its own DDoS protection. | Low |
| R10 | Key rotation causes temporary service disruption | Low | High | Medium | Rotation runbook includes soak period. Old version disabled (not destroyed) for 30 days. | Low |

### 11.3 Formal Validation Plan

---

## 12. Payment System Specifics

### 12.1 Gateway Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Stripe | Decision |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| PCI Level 1 certification | ✅ | Required |
| India support (INR, UPI, netbanking) | ✅ Stripe India | Required |
| Global card support | ✅ | Required |
| Hosted checkout page (SAQ A eligible) | ✅ Stripe Checkout | Required |
| Recurring billing (subscriptions) | ✅ | Required |
| Customer portal (self-service) | ✅ Stripe Billing Portal | Required |
| Webhook reliability (retry, signing) | ✅ 72h retry, HMAC-SHA256 | Required |
| Developer SDK (Node.js) | ✅ `stripe` npm package | Required |
| Pricing | 2% + ₹2 (India) / 2.9% + $0.30 (US) | Acceptable |

### 12.2 Integration Approach

**Mode: Stripe Checkout (Redirect)**

This is the most secure integration mode. The user is redirected entirely to Stripe's hosted checkout page. No card data, card form, or Stripe.js elements are embedded in ActionStation's frontend.

```
User clicks "Upgrade" → Cloud Function creates Checkout Session → Returns URL
→ Browser redirects to checkout.stripe.com → User enters card on Stripe's page
→ Payment processed → Stripe fires webhook → Cloud Function updates Firestore
→ User redirected to success_url → Client reads subscription from Firestore
```

**Why not Stripe Elements (embedded):**
- Stripe Elements would require SAQ A-EP (more compliance burden)
- Stripe Checkout provides better conversion rates (pre-built, optimized UI)
- Stripe Checkout automatically handles UPI, netbanking, and local payment methods in India
- Simpler integration = smaller attack surface

### 12.3 Tokenization Strategy

ActionStation does **not** handle tokenization — Stripe handles it entirely:

1. **Card input** → Stripe Checkout hosted page (PCI-certified environment)
2. **Tokenization** → Stripe creates `tok_xxx` internally
3. **Payment method storage** → Stripe creates `pm_xxx` (saved to Stripe Vault)
4. **What ActionStation receives** → Only `cus_xxx` (customer ID) and `sub_xxx` (subscription ID) via webhook
5. **What ActionStation stores** → `stripeCustomerId`, `stripeSubscriptionId`, `stripePriceId` — **never** any token or card data

### 12.4 Fraud Prevention

| Layer | Mechanism | Implementation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Stripe Radar** | ML-based fraud detection | Enabled by default on Stripe account |
| **Bot detection** | UA + heuristic analysis | `botDetector.ts` on checkout endpoint |
| **IP rate limiting** | Prevent checkout session spam | `ipRateLimiter.ts` on checkout endpoint |
| **Auth requirement** | Only authenticated users can create checkout | Firebase Auth ID token verification |
| **Velocity check** | Max 5 checkout sessions per user per hour | User rate limiter on checkout endpoint |
| **Turnstile CAPTCHA** | Challenge on login (pre-payment) | `verifyTurnstile.ts` + client widget |
| **Metadata verification** | userId in checkout metadata must match auth | Verified in createCheckoutSession |

### 12.5 Reconciliation

| Type | Frequency | Method |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Real-time** | Every webhook | Webhook event → Firestore subscription update |
| **Daily** | Automated | Compare `subscription/current` docs against Stripe API (list active subscriptions). Log discrepancies. |
| **Monthly** | Manual | Stripe Dashboard → Revenue report vs Firestore Pro user count |
| **On-demand** | Manual trigger | Cloud Function `reconcileSubscriptions` — iterates all users, checks Stripe status, fixes drift |

**Reconciliation Cloud Function (future, post-Phase 2):**
```typescript
// Pseudocode — not built in Phase 2, placeholder for Phase 3
// Lists all Stripe subscriptions, compares with Firestore
// Fixes drift: if Stripe says cancelled but Firestore says active → update Firestore
```

### 12.6 Audit Logs for Payment Events

Every payment event generates a structured log entry:

```json
{
  "severity": "INFO",
  "message": "SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE",
  "labels": {
    "eden_security": "true",
    "event_type": "checkout.session.completed",
    "stripe_event_id": "evt_1NQalqBcVyPrVv0ZOm1O0RqM",
    "user_id": "firebase-uid-xxx",
    "old_tier": "free",
    "new_tier": "pro",
    "stripe_customer_id": "cus_xxx",
    "stripe_subscription_id": "sub_xxx",
    "price_id": "price_xxx",
    "currency": "inr",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### 12.7 Payment Incident Response

#### Runbook: Webhook Delivery Failure

```
TRIGGER: No webhook events received for >1 hour (monitoring alert)
1. Check Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Recent events
2. If events show "pending" or "failed": Stripe is retrying. Monitor.
3. If events show "succeeded" but no Cloud Logging entries:
   a. Check Cloud Functions deployment status
   b. Check Cloud Armor logs for blocked Stripe IPs
   c. Check stripeWebhook function logs for errors
4. If Stripe is healthy but events not arriving:
   a. Verify webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard
   b. Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correct (may have been rotated)
   c. Test with Stripe CLI: stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
5. For missed events during outage:
   a. Use Stripe CLI to replay events: stripe events resend evt_xxx
   b. Idempotency guard prevents duplicate processing
6. Post-resolution: update incident log, notify affected users if applicable
```

#### Runbook: Payment Failure Spike

```
TRIGGER: >10 payment failures in 1 hour (monitoring alert)
1. Check Stripe Dashboard → Payments → Failed
2. Categorize failures:
   a. Card declined (customer-side) → No action, Stripe sends failure email
   b. Insufficient funds (customer-side) → No action
   c. Stripe API error (5xx) → Check Stripe Status page
   d. Our webhook returning 5xx → Check Cloud Function logs
3. If Stripe API error:
   a. Monitor Stripe Status (status.stripe.com)
   b. Existing subscriptions unaffected (Stripe retries billing)
   c. New checkouts: show "Payment temporarily unavailable" message
4. If our webhook error:
   a. Check Cloud Function error logs
   b. Fix and redeploy
   c. Stripe will retry failed webhooks automatically
5. Post-resolution: update incident log
```

#### Runbook: Suspected Stripe Key Compromise

```
TRIGGER: Unusual API activity in Stripe Dashboard, or secret detected in logs/code
1. IMMEDIATELY: Roll the Stripe API key in Stripe Dashboard
   a. Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys → Roll key
   b. Stripe provides a grace period where both old and new keys work
2. Update Secret Manager with new key:
   gcloud secrets versions add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --data-file=- <<< "sk_live_NEW..."
3. Force redeploy all Cloud Functions that use the key:
   firebase deploy --only functions:createCheckoutSession,functions:createBillingPortalSession
4. Verify new key works: test checkout session creation
5. Disable old key version in Secret Manager:
   gcloud secrets versions disable OLD_VERSION --secret=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
6. If webhook secret compromised, also roll in Stripe Dashboard and update:
   gcloud secrets versions add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET --data-file=- <<< "whsec_NEW..."
   firebase deploy --only functions:stripeWebhook
7. Review Stripe Dashboard → Logs for unauthorized API calls during exposure window
8. Review Cloud Audit Logs for unauthorized secret access
9. File security incident report
10. Destroy compromised secret version after 30-day observation
```

## 13. Operational Readiness

### 13.1 Deployment Architecture

**Current:** Firebase Hosting (static) + Cloud Functions (serverless)
**No change to architecture.** Cloud Functions are the right fit — no containers, no Kubernetes, no EC2.

**Deployment Strategy: Blue/Green via Firebase Hosting Channels**

```
1. Deploy to preview channel: firebase hosting:channel:deploy pr-NNN
2. Smoke test on preview URL
3. Promote to live: firebase hosting:clone pr-NNN:live
4. For Cloud Functions: firebase deploy --only functions (atomic deployment)
```

**Canary for Payment Launch:**
1. Deploy Cloud Functions with payment endpoints
2. Feature flag: `PAYMENT_ENABLED` env var (default: false)
3. Enable for 10% of users (by userId hash) for 4 hours
4. Monitor: checkout success rate, webhook processing time, error rate
5. If healthy: enable for 100%
6. If unhealthy: disable flag (instant rollback, no redeploy)

### 13.2 Rollback Procedures

| Component | Rollback Method | RTO |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Cloud Functions** | `firebase functions:rollback FUNCTION_NAME` or redeploy previous commit | <5 min |
| **Firebase Hosting** | `firebase hosting:clone PREVIOUS_VERSION:live` | <2 min |
| **Firestore data** | Restore from immutable GCS backup (daily) | <30 min |
| **Secret Manager** | `gcloud secrets versions access PREVIOUS_VERSION --secret=NAME` | <5 min |
| **Cloud Armor WAF** | `gcloud compute security-policies delete POLICY` (removes WAF, traffic flows direct) | <5 min |
| **Stripe configuration** | Stripe Dashboard (products, prices, webhook endpoints) | <5 min |

### 13.3 Uptime Targets

| Component | Target | Monitoring |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Firebase Hosting (SPA) | 99.95% (Firebase SLA) | Uptime monitor on `/` |
| Cloud Functions (payment endpoints) | 99.9% | Uptime monitor on `/health` + Stripe webhook delivery success rate |
| Stripe Checkout | 99.99% (Stripe SLA) | status.stripe.com |
| Firestore | 99.999% (Firebase SLA) | GCP Console monitoring |

### 13.4 Disaster Recovery

| Scenario | RPO | RTO | Recovery |
|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Cloud Function deployment failure | 0 (no data loss) | <5 min | Rollback to previous version |
| Firestore corruption | 24 hours (daily backup) | <30 min | Restore from immutable GCS backup |
| Secret Manager unavailable | 0 (versioned) | <5 min | Use previous secret version |
| Stripe outage | 0 (Stripe manages) | Per Stripe SLA | Wait for Stripe recovery; existing subscriptions unaffected |
| GCP region failure | 24 hours (daily backup) | <4 hours | Restore to different region (requires manual intervention) |

### 13.5 Backups

| Data | Backup Method | Frequency | Retention | Location |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Firestore | `firestoreBackup` Cloud Function → GCS | Daily (02:00 UTC) | 30-day immutable + 90-day lifecycle | `gs://actionstation-244f0-firestore-backups-immutable` |
| Secret Manager | Automatic versioning | On every change | All versions until destroyed | GCP Secret Manager (multi-region) |
| Cloud Functions code | Git repository | On every commit | Indefinite | GitHub |
| Stripe data | Stripe infrastructure | Continuous | Per Stripe DPA | Stripe |

### 13.6 Business Continuity

| Event | Impact | Continuity Plan |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Stripe complete outage** | New subscriptions blocked; existing subscriptions unaffected (Firestore SSOT) | Show "Payment temporarily unavailable" banner. Users retain current access. |
| **GCP regional outage** | All services down | Wait for GCP recovery (SLA). Communicate via status page (external to GCP). |
| **Key compromise** | Potential unauthorized access | Immediate revocation + rotation (see Runbook). Grace period on old key prevents downtime. |
| **Developer unavailability** | No deploys | Documented runbooks enable any team member to execute. All procedures are scriptable. |

## 15. Data Protection Specifics

### 15.1 Encryption Standards

| Context | Standard | Details |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Client ↔ Firebase Hosting** | TLS 1.3 (preferred), TLS 1.2 (minimum) | Google-managed certificate via Firebase Hosting. HSTS enforced. |
| **Client ↔ Cloud Functions** | TLS 1.3/1.2 | Via Cloud Armor HTTPS LB with Google-managed cert for `actionstation.so` |
| **Cloud Functions ↔ Stripe** | TLS 1.2+ | Stripe SDK enforces minimum TLS 1.2. Certificate pinning by Stripe. |
| **Cloud Functions ↔ Firestore** | TLS 1.2+ (GCP internal) | Google internal network, encrypted by default |
| **Cloud Functions ↔ Secret Manager** | TLS 1.2+ (GCP internal) | Google internal network |
| **Firestore at rest** | AES-256 | GCP default encryption. Google-managed keys (DEK + KEK via Cloud KMS). |
| **GCS backups at rest** | AES-256 | GCP default + immutable retention (Decision 29) |
| **Secret Manager at rest** | AES-256 envelope | Per-version DEK encrypted with KEK in Cloud KMS |

### 15.2 Key Management with Multi-Region Audit Trails

**Secret Manager replication:**
- Default: Automatic replication across GCP regions
- Audit: Cloud Audit Logs record every access with source region, caller identity, timestamp
- Logs retained for 400 days (GCP default for Admin Activity + Data Access logs)

**Cloud KMS (underpinning Secret Manager):**
- KEK stored in Cloud KMS within the project region (`us-central1`)
- Cloud KMS provides FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs
- Key hierarchy: Customer Master Key (Cloud KMS) → Key Encryption Key → Data Encryption Key → Secret data

### 15.3 Key Backup and Restore Procedures

#### Backup
Secret Manager provides automatic versioning. Every time a secret is updated, the previous version is retained.

```bash
# List all versions of a secret
gcloud secrets versions list STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# Access a specific version
gcloud secrets versions access 3 --secret=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# Latest version is always used by Cloud Functions (defineSecret)
```

#### Restore (from previous version)
```bash
# If current version is bad, disable it
gcloud secrets versions disable CURRENT_VERSION --secret=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# The previous enabled version becomes "latest"
# Cloud Functions will use it on next cold start

# Force immediate cold start
gcloud functions deploy createCheckoutSession --no-traffic
gcloud functions deploy createCheckoutSession --traffic 100
```

#### Cross-Region Recovery
```bash
# Secret Manager replicates across regions automatically
# If us-central1 is down, secrets are accessible from other regions
# Cloud Functions in a different region can access the same secrets
```

### 15.4 Key Rotation Schedules

| Secret | Rotation | Method | Downtime |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | 90 days | Stripe Dashboard → roll key → Secret Manager update | Zero (Stripe grace period) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | 90 days | Stripe Dashboard → roll endpoint secret → Secret Manager | Zero (dual-secret support during rotation) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | 90 days | GCP Console → regenerate → Secret Manager | Zero (version switch) |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | 180 days | Cloudflare Dashboard → rotate → Secret Manager | Zero (version switch) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | 365 days | Google Cloud Console → OAuth credentials → new secret | Brief (requires redeploy) |

### 15.5 Access Reviews

| Review | Frequency | Scope | Reviewer |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Secret Manager IAM | Monthly | Who has `secretmanager.secretAccessor` role | Security lead |
| GCP IAM | Monthly | All project-level IAM bindings | Security lead |
| Firebase Console access | Monthly | Who has Firebase project access | Product lead |
| Stripe Dashboard access | Monthly | Who has Stripe account access | Business owner |
| GitHub repository access | Monthly | Who has push/admin access | Backend lead |

### 15.6 Preventing Key Loss and Leakage

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **No secrets in code** | Gitleaks in CI pipeline (existing). Blocks push on detection. |
| **No secrets in client bundle** | Structural test: scan `src/` for `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` references (D29) |
| **No secrets in logs** | `filterPromptOutput` scans for API key patterns. Security logger never includes secret values. |
| **No secrets in error reports** | Sentry `maskAllText: true`, `blockAllMedia: true`. No secret values in breadcrumbs. |
| **No secrets in env files** | `.env.example` has placeholder values only. `.gitignore` excludes `.env.local`. |
| **Version history** | Secret Manager retains all versions. Accidental deletion of latest version → previous version available. |
| **Break-glass access** | Organization Admin can access secrets if all team members unavailable. Documented procedure. |
| **Terraform/IaC for IAM** | Future: manage IAM bindings via Terraform to prevent manual IAM drift |

## 16. Tooling Stack

| Category | Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| **Payment Gateway** | Stripe (India + Global) | Checkout, subscriptions, billing portal | 2% + ₹2 per txn (India) |
| **Secrets Management** | Google Cloud Secret Manager | All API keys and signing secrets | $0.06/10K access ops |

**File:** `src/features/subscription/hooks/useCheckout.ts`

```typescript
import { useCallback, useRef } from 'react';
import { useAuthStore } from '@/features/auth/stores/authStore';
import { getAuthToken } from '@/features/auth/services/authTokenService';
import { logger } from '@/shared/services/logger';
import { strings } from '@/shared/localization/strings';

const CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_URL;

interface UseCheckoutReturn {
    startCheckout: (priceId: string) => Promise<void>;

export function useCheckout(): UseCheckoutReturn {
    const userId = useAuthStore((s) => s.user?.id);
    const userIdRef = useRef(userId);
    userIdRef.current = userId;

    // Stable callback — deps are [] via useRef pattern (Decision 12)
    const startCheckout = useCallback(async (priceId: string) => {
        const uid = userIdRef.current;
        if (!uid) {
            logger.warn('Checkout attempted without auth');
            return;
        }

            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ priceId }),
            signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000),

        window.location.href = checkoutUrl; // Redirect to Stripe Checkout
    }, []);

## Appendix A: Architectural Decisions for MEMORY.md

The following decisions should be appended to `MEMORY.md` as they are implemented:

### Decision 31 (Planned) — Stripe Checkout Redirect Mode

**Problem:** Need payment integration that is PCI SAQ A compliant with minimal attack surface.

**Decision:** Use Stripe Checkout in redirect mode (not embedded Elements). Card data never enters ActionStation's domain. `createCheckoutSession` Cloud Function creates the session; browser redirects to `checkout.stripe.com`.

**Rationale:** SAQ A eligible. No `stripe.js` tokenization on our domain. Smallest PCI scope possible.

### Decision 32 (Planned) — Webhook Idempotency via Firestore

**Problem:** Stripe may deliver the same webhook event multiple times. Processing duplicates would cause incorrect subscription state.

**Decision:** `_webhookEvents/{eventId}` collection serves as an idempotency guard. Before processing any webhook event, check if `eventId` exists. After processing, write the record. 30-day TTL auto-deletes old records.

**Collection:** `_webhookEvents` — no client access (Firestore rules: `allow read, write: if false`).

### Decision 33 (Planned) — Stripe Webhook Excluded from Bot Detection

**Problem:** Stripe webhook requests come from Stripe's servers and would be flagged by `botDetector.ts` (no browser UA, no standard headers).

**Decision:** `stripeWebhook` Cloud Function does NOT run `detectBot()`. Security is provided by HMAC-SHA256 signature verification instead. This is safer than UA-based detection because the signature cryptographically proves the sender.

### Decision 34 (Planned) — Publishable Key as Build-Time Env Var

**Problem:** Stripe Checkout redirect mode requires the Stripe publishable key client-side to construct the Checkout URL (when using client-side redirect).

**Decision:** `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is a build-time env var in `deploy.yml`. This is safe — publishable keys are designed to be public. They can only create Checkout Sessions (which are further validated server-side). Structural test ensures `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are NEVER in client code.
